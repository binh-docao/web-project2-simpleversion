<!-- Description of Pictures-->
<div class = "servicetext">
    Throughout my time here at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>, I have had the opportunity to not only serve my fellow students, but also the residents of College Station, those affected by breast cancer, and children who have been impacted by their parent’s cancer. The main means I have been able to give back is thanks to the events/organizations listed here:
    <br></br>
<bl>
    <li><a href="https://fishcamp.tamu.edu/">Fish Camp</a>: I was blessed enough to have been a Fish Camp counselor for three years. Fish Camp had such a profound impact on me as a freshman that I just had to get involved in order to be able to give that same experience to the incoming freshmen. Being there for them, introducing them to A&M’s values and traditions, and easing their nerves in a period of great transition all made it worth it. I was in Camp Hart, Camp Scott, and Camp Weeks. </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">The Big Event</a>: This is the largest student-organized service event in the nation. It is an opportunity to bring Aggies together to give back to the community within the College Station/Bryan area. It is a means of showing our appreciation to the residents here for dealing with all the chaos, drama, and traffic of a college town. I have been able to do this for two years and both times I was blessed with a chance to meet a great family, do some great work for them, and grow closer with my fellow students.</li>
    <br></br>
    <li><a href="https://www.tamucenturymen.com/watermelon-bash">Watermelon Bash</a> This is an event put on and hosted by Century Men’s Society, a men’s organization I am involved with on campus. It is a large carnival-style event hosted at Wolf Pen Creek; there are a plethora of games and activities available. All proceeds go to our philanthropy, Camp Kesem, a summer camp available to kids whose parents are affected by cancer. </li>
    <br></br>
    <li><a href="https://texasam.crowdchange.co/18842">Queso for a Cause</a>: Working for a sorority this past year, I was blessed with the opportunity to assist with their philanthropy event. It is an event that features a multitude of cheesy foods/activities. All proceeds were donated to their philanthropy, Breast Cancer Education and Awareness. </li>
